   "description": "This policy identifies RDS instances which have Multi-Availability Zone(Multi-AZ) disabled. When RDS DB instance is enabled with Multi-AZ, RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different availability zone. These Multi-AZ deployments will improve primary node reachability by providing read replica in case of network connectivity loss or loss of availability in the primaryâ€™s availability zone for read/write operations, so by making them the best fit for production database workloads.",
