   "description": "This policy identifies Kubernetes Engine Clusters which have disabled Alias IP. Alias IP allows the networking layer to perform anti-spoofing checks to ensure that egress traffic is not sent with arbitrary source IPs. By enabling Alias IPs, Kubernetes Engine clusters can allocate IP addresses from a CIDR block known to Google Cloud Platform. This makes your cluster more scalable and allows your cluster to better interact with other GCP products and entities."
