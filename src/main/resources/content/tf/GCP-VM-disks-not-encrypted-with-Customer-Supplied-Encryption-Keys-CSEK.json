  "description": "This policy identifies VM disks which are not encrypted with Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys (CSEK). If you provide your own encryption keys, Compute Engine uses your key to protect the Google-generated keys used to encrypt and decrypt your data. It is recommended to use VM disks encrypted with CSEK for business-critical VM instances."
